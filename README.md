# Etch-A-Sketch

A fun take on the classic Etach-A-Sketch game with options to choose your drawing color or use a fun random color generator. 
The size of the drawing board can be changed as well. 

This project gave me a lot of practice with event listners and dynamically creating elements and using function based on HTML inputs.
